## New Official Room: The Lobby

![omega1](./omega1.png)

We're releasing the first room in the all-new "Omega Corporation" pack, which will join "Labyrinth of Egypt", "Adrift in Space" and "Edgewood Mansion" as the 4th room pack. And best of all, you get to play it for free! The rest of the rooms from the packs are going to come in the coming two months.

## Spooky season calls for spooky assets!

We're adding Halloween assets to the room editor. Enjoy the pumpkins and candy! :)

We've also added effects. You can now have things such as smoke, fire, and sparks in your rooms. Special logic fog component was also added so you can turn your environment spookiness to 11!

You can also see the video overview by our designated room designer Matija:
