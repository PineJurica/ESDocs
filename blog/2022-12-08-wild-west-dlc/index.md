Bugs are pesky little things, aren't they? Before you know it, you have an infestation on your hands. Obviously, no one wants that for Escape Simulator! That is why all of the bug reports and general feedback we receive from our community is always extremely valuable to us.

Over the past few weeks, we have been working hard to address as many of your reports as possible.  To make sure you get the fully optimized Wild West experience, we are also releasing an additional update today. This update should fix a great amount of known bugs and issues. Through this update, we hope to enhance the Escape Simulator experience even further. It is of great importance to us that anyone who supports our game gets to fully enjoy Escape Simulator as it was intended. You can find a full overview of the different bugs that were addressed here.
