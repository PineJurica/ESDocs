## Peace out! ‚úåÔ∏è

![Room](./room.png)

We hope you like lava lamps and disco balls, because it's time to go back to the 70's. That's right, we're releasing a brand-new room for Escape Simulator **today**! In order to escape from this incredibly cozy looking room, you'll need to know your way around some 'ancient' technology, such as cassette decks and a very retro game console. So vintage!

<!--truncate-->

That's not all, though! The **70's room** is part of our latest update, which also contains a whole bunch of additional features for the room editor. We hope you're excited to start using these features, builders! Additionally, this update contains the following tweaks:

- Different internal level packing, the game should be smaller on disk. It's about 5GB smaller than before!
- New hint system that tracks what puzzle you are playing and gives relevant hints
- Localization fixes
- Separated settings and save files. Only save is uploaded to cloud save, meaning settings is local to the machine.
- Faster performance mode for custom rooms
- Disable shadows option has 2x increased FPS in built-in rooms
- Chat key is can be rebound to different key
- Changed how zooms are calculated, some items are now bigger for better clarity
- Better controller support
- Better support for breaking hanging objects (plants, mirrors, ...)
- Its easier to use slots with controller with new Controller-Slot interaction UX

More patch notes can be found right here!

## More rooms to check out! üëÄ

We really hope you'll enjoy this free update and that you'll continue to look forward to even more rooms in the future! We're working really hard to bring a bunch of additional rooms to the game and of course we're always trying to further improve upon the room editor as well.
