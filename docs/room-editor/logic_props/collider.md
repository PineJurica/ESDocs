# Collider

An invisible barrier that will stop items and clicks from going through an area, but by default, not the player.

### Common uses for a collider prop
1. Can be used to create a new "hit box" for something that has had its collider disabled
2. Can be used to prevent someone from interacting with a button or slot
3. Can be used as an obstacle instead of the "Obstacle" prop if you want something that also prevents clicks (this has a caveat though: if someone gets too close to it you can click through it, just like cupboards etc.)
